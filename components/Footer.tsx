              My teammate Jimmy got a brand-new MacBook. M5 Pro chip, 48GB of RAM. One of
              the fastest laptops you can buy. For two months, he didn't touch it, and kept
              working on his old Windows laptop instead. He said, "Mac is better as a
              paperweight."
            </p>
            <p>
              Jimmy is not alone. I made the same switch ten years ago, and it was painful.
              Every app and every keyboard shortcut worked differently, and I had to relearn
              all of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I built this, for Jimmy and everyone making the same move: from the world's
              best business laptop to the most advanced coding machine.
