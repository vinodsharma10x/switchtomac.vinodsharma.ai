        A brand-new MacBook sat unused for two months.
      </h1>

      <p className="mt-5 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        Forty-eight gigabytes of RAM. The M5 chip. One of the fastest laptops you can buy.
        And for two months, my teammate Jimmy did not turn it on.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        Not because anything was wrong with it. Because he had spent fifteen years on
        Windows, and every one of those years was muscle memory he was about to lose. He
        knew where everything was. He could work without looking. Switching meant going
        back to zero.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">So the Mac sat there. His words, not mine:</p>
      <blockquote className="my-6 border-l-2 border-accent pl-4 text-[16.5px] italic text-muted">
        "Mac is better as a paperweight."
      </blockquote>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        He was half joking. He was also completely serious.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-[22px] font-semibold tracking-[-0.02em]">
        The small things are the hard things.
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        When you have used Windows for fifteen or twenty years, the big stuff is fine. You
        can figure out a new app. What breaks you is the small stuff you never had to think
        about.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        How do I open the file manager? It's called Finder, and there is no Win+E.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        Where did my screenshot go? The Desktop, and the keys are nothing like the ones you
        knew.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        How do I add an SSH key on this thing?
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        That last one turned into a two-day saga. Jimmy was trying to get a single SSH key
        working so he could push code. Tried it on Windows. Blocked. Tried it on the new
        Mac. Same wall. By the end he had a running joke going with half the team. Some of
        it was a network setting, some of it was simply not knowing where things live on a
        Mac yet. Either way, what should have been five minutes ate two days. That is the
        kind of friction that makes a new machine feel like a punishment instead of an
        upgrade.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        The problem was never that any of it is hard. The problem is that nobody hands you
        the translation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-[22px] font-semibold tracking-[-0.02em]">
        I know this story because it was mine.
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        Ten years ago, I switched from Windows to a MacBook.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        My first computer was a Windows machine, back in 2000. I spent fifteen solid years
        on it. I knew every shortcut. I could fly through my work without touching a mouse,
        because I never wanted to. Keyboard for everything.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        Then I moved to a Mac, and overnight, all of it was gone.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        The shortcuts I had burned into my hands for fifteen years did nothing. I hated
        being forced onto the trackpad. Even taking a screenshot, something I had done a
        thousand times without thinking, turned into something I had to stop and look up.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        And when I looked it up, there was no good single answer. One website had half the
        shortcuts. Another had the rest. I would bookmark them both, then switch back and
        forth between tabs trying to remember which one had the thing I needed. It was slow,
        and it made me feel slow, which was the worse part.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        I got through it. But it took far longer than it should have, and nobody had handed
        me a map.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-[22px] font-semibold tracking-[-0.02em]">
        It is not just us.
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        When Jimmy hit the same wall, I went looking. The internet is full of people
        standing exactly where he was standing.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        A developer on Hacker News venting that the Delete key works backward. Someone on
        Apple's own forums asking how to make the shortcuts behave like Windows again. A
        first-time MacBook owner who said that every time they tried to do something with
        the keyboard it failed, and they could not understand why everything had to be so
        different. Even O'Reilly's guide to switching opens by warning you that moving to a
        Mac means switching your brain.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        Different people, different years, the same frustration. Capable people losing their
        fluency the moment they sat down at a new machine. Thousands of them, and probably
        far more who never said a word and just quietly struggled, or gave up and went back
        to Windows.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-[22px] font-semibold tracking-[-0.02em]">
        So I built this, for Jimmy and everyone like him.
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        I did not want Jimmy to go through what I went through. I did not want him losing
        days to something a good reference could have answered in seconds.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        So instead of sending him one more half-finished cheat sheet, I built the one I wish
        someone had handed me ten years ago. Every Windows shortcut next to its Mac
        equivalent. The everyday things that do not map to a single key, explained in plain
        language. One place. Searchable. No tab-switching, no guessing.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        Here is the part most switching guides bury: your fingers already know almost all of
        this. You are not starting over. Most of the time you are just pressing Command
        where you used to press Ctrl. Once someone shows you that, the fear drops away, and
        the expensive laptop stops being a paperweight.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.7] text-ink-2">
        That is the only reason this site exists.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-10 font-display text-[22px] font-semibold tracking-[-0.02em]">
        Open, and free.
