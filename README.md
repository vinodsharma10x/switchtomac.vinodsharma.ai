# Switch — From Windows to Mac, without the friction

A free, open-source guide for people moving from a Windows PC to a Mac.

**Live:** [switchtomac.app](https://switchtomac.app)

> Almost every Windows shortcut works on a MacBook. You just press **Command (⌘)** where you used to press **Ctrl**. Your fingers already know the shortcuts, you just need to know which keys moved.

---

## What's inside

- **The shortcut cheat sheet** — every Windows keyboard shortcut next to its Mac equivalent, searchable and grouped by category.
- **Everyday guides** — the tasks that don't map to a single key (right-click, screenshots, where downloads go).
- **Blog** — short, single-question posts for people switching.
- **Videos** — a curated set of YouTube walkthroughs.

All shortcut and guide data is verified against Apple's documentation for **macOS Tahoe (macOS 26)**.

## Editing content

Everything is data-driven. Change the data, and the pages, search, sitemap, and `llms-full.txt` all update.

**Add a shortcut or a guide** — edit [`lib/shortcuts.ts`](lib/shortcuts.ts):

```ts
// A shortcut row
{ c: "essentials", a: "Copy", w: ["Ctrl", "C"], m: ["⌘", "C"] }

// An everyday guide
{ c: "files", t: "Where did my download go?", win: "Downloads folder",
  m: "Dock & Finder sidebar", how: "Downloads land in the Downloads folder..." }
```

**Add a blog post** — drop a `.mdx` file in [`content/blog/`](content/blog/):

```mdx
---
title: "Your post title"
date: "2026-06-20"
excerpt: "One-line summary for the list and SEO."
author: "Vinod Sharma"
tags: ["basics"]
---

Your content. You can use the <KeyCombo spec={["⌘", "C"]} mac /> component inline.
```

**Add a video** — paste a YouTube ID into [`lib/videos.ts`](lib/videos.ts).

**Site-wide settings** (name, URL, social, macOS version) live in [`lib/site.ts`](lib/site.ts).

---

## SEO & GEO

Built in:

- `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` (allows Google and all major AI crawlers: GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, and more)
- JSON-LD structured data (WebSite, Person, BlogPosting, Blog, BreadcrumbList, AboutPage)
- Per-page canonicals + OpenGraph/Twitter metadata
- `feed.xml` (RSS 2.0)
- **`llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`** — LLM-readable summaries, including the full Windows→Mac shortcut tables, so AI assistants can cite accurate answers.

---

## Analytics (optional)

Analytics is off unless you provide a Google Tag Manager container. Everything else (GA4, Clarity, etc.) is configured inside GTM, not in code.

```bash
# .env.local (or Vercel env vars)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX
```

When set, the site loads GTM with **Consent Mode v2** and shows a lightweight cookie-consent banner (analytics defaults to denied in the EEA/UK/CH until accepted). When unset, no analytics and no banner load.

---

## Deployment

Deploys to Vercel from `main`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` in the project's environment variables (it is inlined at build time, so it applies on the next deploy).
